# zenstack-ui

Customizable react components for zenstack and prisma (forms/lists/etc.)

This library is a work in progress, and may not be ready for production yet. Many new features are coming soon.

Currently, you can use it to automatically create entire forms and lists based on your zmodel zenstack schema. Check out the docs to learn more.
